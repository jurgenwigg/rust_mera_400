# Learning Rust by creating emulator of Mera400 CPU

## Short introduction
I decided to learn Rust programming language by creating something that is not created already in Rust. I would also learn how CPU is working on a very low level. There will be a lot of experiments but learning language with something practical works the best for me :)

## Short roadmap
- [ ] Create architecture to implement registers of CPU
- [ ] Create CI for implemented code
- [ ] Implement base for all registers
- [ ] Implement universal registers
* For all implementations tests (unit tests and, if possible, integration tests) should be also provided.
